### PROJECT TASKS

__1. Determine System Framework__  
Some Text    
__2. Setup Working Environments__  
I would initially propose to have 3 working environments. This would involve a Development Environment (DEV), a Staging Environment (STAGE) and a Live Environment (LIVE). All this environments should have a repository for version control in place. All initial development would take place in the DEV environment, when ready the work would move to the STAGE environment for more rigorous and thorough testing. Once the testing is complete and we have had the sign off that testing is complete and satisfactory, it would then move to the LIVE environment. If any problems are encountered at any point, work would move back to the DEV environment and then once again moved to STAGE for testing. Nothing would move to LIVE until everyone is completely happy for this to proceed.  
__3. Core Functionality  
Core Functionality 
__4. Point 4__   
External integration of job boards and psychometric testing  
__5. Point 5__  
Incorporate CDN secure encryption and secure access of any uploaded documents.  
__6. Browser and Compatibility Testing__  
The site will be tested to make sure it works with a wide selection of browsers and to ensure it does not break when viewed on mobile devices or tablets.  
__7. Data Collection__  
All data collection analysis needs to be tested such as notifications of when emails sent, candidates have logged onto sites, tests, forms and contracts are completed.  

## DELIVERABLES AND COMPONENTS

### Deliverables
1. Build Core Functionality  
We will need to prioritise building the form features initially as so many other components depend on them. Other features need the ability to be switched on and off when required as the project progresses.
2. Portal site design  
Replicate existing client site templates.
3. Reporting on all aspects of system functionality
4. Ensure third party data connections can be monitored and are working correctly  .
5. Draft version of site, once all relevant content for the site we have been provided and applicable feature built this will be loaded in and testing can begin. Digital sign off will be required before deploying to the Live Site.
6. Final version of site with relevant training that will be conducted on features and administration of the site. 
7. Plan any additional phase 2 requirements.

### Components

Component 1 | User Account and Profile(s)  
Accounts primarily will be created but registration to the site should also be available, further access to other features like user, group and allocated services will be determined by user access levels.

Component 2 | Site Backup & Security  
A hard backup copy of the files associated with the site will be delivered on completion to the client on a memory stick, as well as backed up to appropriate secure location(s). Where appropriate the most secure encryption methods will be used with data transfer.

Component 3 | Training Documents  
A reference document outlining how to make updates to the site along with a link to online resources will be built as project develops.
